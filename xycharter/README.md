# xycharter
A Java charting library for the two-dimensional rendering of numerical data.


XYCharter is a Java2D data plotting framework. It was initially for a project in 2000 at CRS4 (http://www.crs4.it) as graphical Swing component for the on-the-fly map rendering of simulation of the car traffic in the city of Cagliari. Since then its usages have been diverse, and XYCharter has naturally bent towards the plotting of evolving 2D data. Most of the time, it is now motivated by the need of scientific applications to expose their behaviour at runtime.

XYCharter is able to draw into a Swing component as well as to standard image file formats like SVG and PNG.

XYCharter is designed to be as customisable as possible. Every element (axis, graduation, arrows, grids, curves, legends, etc) of the drawing pane can be customized by the programmer in terms of its visibility, color, width, length, etc.
